For our IDM 231 term project we were tasked with creating a website that shows users *something* when they enter in their birthday and recieve their Zodiac. I chose to show users their Jujutsu Kaisen character Zodiac twin. 

This repository is the culmination of that project.

        From a young age, Nobara stood out in her small town, determined to trade the countryside for the big city. She formed deep connections with outsiders like Fumi and Saori, aspiring to escape her village and reunite with them in Tokyo. As a jujutsu sorcerer, Nobara carries herself confidently, unafraid to take charge even when her peers hesitate. Her strong sense of duty and pride as a fighter shine through, particularly in moments of crisis where she remains level-headed and decisive.

## Virgo (Aug 23rd - Sept 22nd)
- Aoi Todo; September 23rd, 2000

        Aoi Todo epitomizes the Virgo traits of meticulousness, organization, and diligence. Despite his eccentricity and love for battle, a subtle self-doubt lingers within him. As a mentor to allies like Yuji, Todo's depth of character shines through. Flamboyant yet deeply intelligent, he navigates battles with confidence and a profound sense of duty.

## Sagittarius (Nov 22nd - Dec 21st)
- Satoru Gojo; December 7th, 1989

        Like his sign, Satoru Gojo is as charismatic as he is flighty.
