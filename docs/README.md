# idm231-mba58

For our IDM 231 term project we were tasked with creating a website that shows users *something* when they enter in their birthday and recieve their Zodiac. I chose to show users their Jujutsu Kaisen character Zodiac twin. 

This repository is the culmination of that project. 

# Index
List of zodiacs and associated characters along with their birthdays and flavor text. 

## Aquarius (Jan 20th - Feb 18th)
- Suguru Geto; Feb 3rd, 1990

        With the grand plans of changing the world, some herald Suguru Geto as a reclusive visionary. As a former jujutsu student, Suguru believed in its teachings, until a tragic event disillusioned him. Despising non-sorcerers, he champions sorcerers as the next evolutionary step. Yet, he deeply treasures fellow curse users, aspiring for sorcerer supremacy.

- Maki Zenin; Jan 20th, 2002
- Mai Zenin; Jan 20th, 2002 
- Utahime Iori; Feb 18th, 1987

## Pisces (Feb 19th - March 20th)
- Panda; March 5th
- Yuta Okkotsu; March 7th, 2001 
- Yuji Itadori; March 20th, 2003

        With a Pisces's imaginative mind, Yuji's nurturing personality is evident. He deeply cares for others, valuing every life and ensuring a proper death. Despite his energetic and outgoing traits, witnessing cruelty ignites intense anger within him. He's willing to sacrifice himself for others, embodying his grandfather's last words.

## Aries (March 21st - April 19th)
- Miwa Kasumi; April 4th, 2001

        An Aries like Kasumi charges forward with unwavering determination, never backing down from a challenge. Despite her inner struggles with imposter syndrome, she exudes kindness and diligence, fueled by her ambition to support her siblings. With each step, she embodies the fiery spirit of her zodiac sign, fearlessly confronting obstacles and showcasing her resilience in the face of adversity.

## Taurus (April 20th - May 20th)
- Kiyotaka Ijichi; April 20th, 1991

        A Taurean like Kiyotaka is fiercely loyal, the epitome of reliability in tough times. Yet, his stubborn nature and penchant for holding grudges make him formidable if crossed. Reserved and professional, he excels as head manager of Jujutsu High, though he becomes nervous when things go awry, especially around his superiors (Gojo), who barrage him with belittling remarks.

## Gemini (May 21st - June 21st)
- Noritoshi Kamo; June 5th, 2000

        Noritoshi is adaptable and resilient, capable of leading in diverse circumstances. Yet, his patience wears thin swiftly, allowing no room for forgiveness once crossed. Stoic and composed, Noritoshi grapples with the complexities of his family's expectations, yearning for acceptance and unity among clans. His journey of self-discovery leads him to shed past burdens, embracing his true self while seeking his place in the world.

## Cancer (June 22nd - July 22nd)

## Sagittarius (Nov 22nd - Dec 21st)
- Satoru Gojo; December 7th, 1989

        Like his sign, Satoru Gojo is as charismatic as he is flighty. As the pride of the Gojo Clan (he is the only member) and the world's strongest jujutsu sorcerer, Satoru embraces the adventurous spirit of his zodiac sign. He uses his influence not just for protection but also to mentor and empower young allies at the Tokyo Jujutsu High.

## Capricorn (Dec 22nd - Jan 19)
