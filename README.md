# idm231-mba58

For our IDM 231 term project we were tasked with creating a website that shows users *something* when they enter in their birthday and recieve their Zodiac. I chose to show users their Jujutsu Kaisen character Zodiac twin. (Maybe, that might change.)

This repository is the culmination of that project.
